# Question 1

R is treating the groups as numbers instead of treating as a as factor. it could be fixed by first transforming the data using as.factor



# Question 2


## Part 1 (A)

```{r,echo=FALSE}

#Q2A
ox <- read_csv("oxygen.csv")


d <- as.factor(ox$distance)



ggplot(data=ox,aes(x=d,y=ox$oxygen)) + 
  geom_boxplot(fill="gray")+
  labs(title="Concentration of Oxygen by distance ",x="Distance", y = "Oxygen (mg/L)")+
  theme_classic()


```



## Part 2 (B)

```{r,echo=FALSE}

#q2B
lmout <- lm(ox$oxygen~d)
anova(lmout)
```

## Part 3 (C)

We reject the null hyphoteses that the average concentration of oxygen between all distances are equal, and can conclude that at least one of them differs. (P-value<0.0001)


## Part 4 (C)

```{r}
plot(lmout)
```



## Part 5 (D)

Looking at the QQ plot, we can conclude that the assumption of normality of has been violated due the the "S" shaped graph. However, despite a light cone shape on the residuals vs fitted graph i do not believe to be enough to discard the equality of variance assumption.




# Question 3


```{r,include=FALSE}

#Q3
tcrit <-qt(.975,df=20)

ci<- 94.5 +c(-1,1)*tcrit*sqrt(10.14/6)
```

95%CI for control= (91.78825,97.21175)

# Question 4

```{r,echo=FALSE}
#Q4
LSD <-tcrit*sqrt(2*10.14/6)

LSD

```



# Question 5




we fail to reject the null hyphoteses that the there is no difference between the average growth of the control group and the ABA treatment. 95%CIcontrol=(91.78825,97.21175)


# Question 6


```{r,echo=FALSE}
#q6
lsdb <- qt(1-0.05/(2*4),df=20)*sqrt(2*10.14/6)
lsdb
```



# Question 7

```{r,echo=FALSE}
lsdb <- qt(1-0.05/(2*4),df=20)*sqrt(2*10.14/6)
ci<- 94.5 +c(-1,1)*lsdb
ci
```
95%CIcontrol=(89.45453,99.54547)


# Question 8
we fail to reject the null hyphoteses that the there is no difference between the average growth of the control group and the ABA treatment. 95%CIcontrol=(89.45453,99.54547)


# Question 9

the coverage is 0.7
